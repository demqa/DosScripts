# DosScripts

These projects I wrote in 16-bit DOS x86 assembly.

1. Frame. Appears on the screen with some message.
2. String Functions. Easy string function, strlen, strcmp, and other. Itoa, atoi for different numberal systems: 2, 8, 10, 16. 
3. Resident program, that uses Interruptions 08h & 09h to steal control and get registers. (Almost great debugger)

And there is folder dos-crashes... There are funny screenshots from development in DOS. Especially developing of resident. ))) It was the best time, really...
